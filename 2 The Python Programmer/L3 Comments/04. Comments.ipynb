    "In time you will come to love Python comments just as much as I do. You've already seen lots of examples. Each Python program in previous lesson started with a comment. Comments allow you to add notes to your programs. As your program get bigger and more complicated you'll want to add comments that describe what your code is doing. Remember, in the furture, as a Python programmer, it may not be you who is reading and using your code, it could be another programmer and comments are a way to help them understand what your code is doing.\n",

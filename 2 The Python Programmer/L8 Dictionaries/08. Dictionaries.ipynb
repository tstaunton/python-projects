We could create a dictionary that represents a car and then store as much information as we need about that car. We could store brand, model, specifications, price, and much more. Dictionaries will allow us to store any two kinds of information that can be matched up such as employees and their salaries, car brands and models and so on.\n",

Each key is connected to a value and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key. In Python, you can use any object that you can create as a value. A key's value can be a number, a string, a list or another dictionary.\n",

Every key is connected to its value by a colon (:), and each key-value pair is separated from one another by a comma (,). You can store as many key-value pairs as you need in a dictionary.\n",

    "The programs that we have been creating so far have helped us learn the basics of Python and how to organize our code. Now it's time to learn how to work with files in Python and how to save data so that we can reuse it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to work with files in Python is a major step in your programming experience as it means you can import data into your programs and export data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading from a file\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start to write Python in the real world and begin to work with other developers you will notice that an incredible amount of data is held in text files. Reading from a file is an essential Python skill. We're going to learn how to read the entire contents of a file and how to work through the contents of a file one line at time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started. The first thing we need is a simple text file which I have prepared with four names in it. now, let's write a program to open, read and print the contents of this file:"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "code",
   "execution_count": null,
   "metadata": {},
   "outputs": [],
   "source": [
    "with open('names.txt') as file_object:\n",
    "    contents = file_object.read()\n",
    "print(contents)"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Most of what we have just written will be new to you so let's step through it. At line 1 we are using the *open()* function. If we want to do any work with a file we first need to open the file to access it. Makes sense! The *open()* function needs one argument, the name of the file that we want to open. Again, makes sense!  Python will look for this file in the directory where the program that's being executed is saved. In this example I have saved the file in the same directory with my Jupyter Notebooks so thats where it looks. The *open()* function returns an object representing the file. Python then assigns this object to *file_object* so that we can work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have opened the file but we haven't closed it. The keyword *with* used in line 1 closes the file for us once our program no longer needs access to it. We could close the file by calling *close()*, but this can sometimes lead to problems, for example, if a bug in our code prevents the *close()* method from being executed, the file may never close. This is not a big issue for us right now but as your programs get bigger, failing to correctly close them will lead to data corruption and loss. There is also the risk that if we call *close()* too early in our program we will end up trying to perform tasks on a closed file which leads to more errors. By using the keyword *with* Python will figure out when to close the file for us when the *with* block finishes execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a file object that represents *names.txt* we can use the *read()* method in line 2. This method will read the entire contents of the file and store it as one long string in the variable *contents*. At line 3, we print the value of *contents* and we see that the entire file is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using a different code editor from Jupyter you may notice that an additional blank line has been added after the last name of the output. This is happening in Jupyter to, it's just harder to see it. The reason this is happening is because the *read()* method returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file. This empty string shows up as blank line. If you want to remove the blank line you can use *rstrip()* in the *print* call.\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(contents.rstrip())\n",
    "    \n",
    "## File paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh god, I hate file paths, they can be so frustrating some times. But they are a necessary evil. In the previous code example we passed in the filename *names.txt* to the *open()* function. Python looked in the directory where the current program file, which is our Jupyter Notebook in this case, is stored. So the first place that Python looks for a file to open is in the home location of the executing program.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be times when you want to open a file that is not in your program's home directory. For example, you might keep your program files in a folder called *my_programs* and keep any files that you need to open in a folder called *my_text_files* that sits inside the *my_programs* folder. Even though *my_text_files* sits inside *my_programs* passing the *open()* method the name of a file in *my_text_files* won't work because Python will only look in *my_programs* and no where else, it's lazy like that. It won't get up off the couch and go look in *my_text_files*, you have to make it. To get Python to open files from a directory other than the one where your program file is stored you need to provide a *file path* which tells Python to stop being so lazy, get up of off the couch and go look in a specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the folder *my_text_files* is inside *my_programs* we can use a relative file path to open a file from *my_text_files*. A relative file path tells Python to look for a given location relative to the directory where the currently running program is stored. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    with open('my_text_files/filename.txt') as file object:\n",
    "    \n",
    "This line of code tells Python to look for the needed .txt file in the folder *my_text_files* and assumes that *my_text_files* is located inside *my_programs* which it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For windows users, the Windows system uses a backslash (\\\\) instead of a forward slash(/) when displaying file paths, but you can still use a forward slash in your code and it will work as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use what are called *absolute file paths*, because these are usually longer than relative file paths it's helpful to assign them to a variable and then pass that variable to *open()*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    file_path = '/home/tonystaunton/projects/python_projects/text_files/filename.txt'\n",
    "    with open(file_path) as file_object:\n",
    "    \n",
    "Absolute file paths allow you to read files from any location on your computer. As our programs our small at the moment I would recommend using relative file paths for the moment and keep your files all within the one project or program folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When using absolute file paths you can't use backslashes because in Python when you place a backslash inside single quotes Python interprets this as an escape character. If you want to use backslashes then you need to use two back slashes, for example, '\\\\home\\\\tonystaunton\\\\projects\\\\python_projects\\\\text_files\\\\filename.txt'\n",

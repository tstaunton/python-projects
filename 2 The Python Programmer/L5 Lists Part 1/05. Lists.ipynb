    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video we're going to learn about Python Lists and how to work with items within the lists we create. Lists do exactly what they say, they store information in one place. A list can be two pieces of information or millions of pieces. You'll come to see and value how powerful lists are as you start to use them. As your Python experience grows you are going to be using lists a lot, and you'll learn how they are used across the Python programming world in areas such as data science and analysis and web development. Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What makes a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a shopping list, it's made up of items, usually one line at a time. The items on your shopping list are created using letters, numbers, names of products to buy, and maybe the odd exclamation mark. Basically, you can put anything you want on your shopping list and they can be completley unrelated. You could have a shopping list for different shops with different items to buy in each shop on your list. The items on your list don't need to be in any particular order either.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because lists usually contain more than one item in them it's good practice to name your lists in the plural:\n",
    "\n",
    "- planes\n",
    "- trains\n",
    "- automobiles\n",
    "- names\n",
    "- staff\n",
    "- groceries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating lists in Pyton\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pyton, lists are created using square brackets ([  ]). Items or what we are now going to call elements within a list are seperated by a comma (,). Let's take a look:"

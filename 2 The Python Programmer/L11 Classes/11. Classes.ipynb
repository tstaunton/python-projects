    "Hopefully by now you have learned and somewhat mastered the basics of Python programming. It's now time to move on and learn about *object-oriented programming*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using object-oriented programming you write *classes* that represent real world things, you then create *objects* based on these classes. When you create a class you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have. When you create objects from a class each object automatically comes with the general behavior of that class. After you create an object you can assign to it any unique behavior that you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of class could be a book or a car. When you create the class book you can define its general behavior, for example, text size, font-type, color and page type (landscape or portrait). Now that we have the book class created we can create an object from that class. Making an object from a class is called *instantiation*. When you are working with objects, you are working with *instances* of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning object-oriented programming is an important step on your Python journey. It will help you write bigger programs that are easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create our first class, the class *ebook*. This class will represent a digital book, not a book for Kindle, or Apple, or a PDF but a general digital book. What do we think is the basic criteria of a digital book? Is should have a name, font-size, font-color, font-type. All of this information will go in our *ebook* class because we can say that they are common to most digital books. Our *ebook* class will instruct Python how to make an object representing an ebook. After we have created our class we'll use it to make instances, each one representing a specific book. Let's go:"

    "We haven't written code like this before so don't worry if you are a bit confused. Let's go through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At line 1 we define a class called *DigitalBook*. In Python capitalized names refer to classes. You'll also note that there are no parentheses in the class definition because we are creating this class from scratch.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The __init__() method\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lessons we have created functions. When you write a function inside a class it is called a method. You don't need to relearn anything about functions, don't worry I haven't wasted your time. The big difference between functions that are outside a class and inside, other than being called methods, is how they are called. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *__init__()* method at line 4 is a special method that Python runs automatically whenever we create a new instance based on the *DigitalBook* class. As you'll have noticed, this method has two leading and two trailing underscores. This helps Python default method names from conflicting with any method names that you may create. If you use only one underscore on each side, then the method won't be called automatically and you'll get unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we define the __init__() method at line 4 we have done so with three paramteres, *self, name,* and *author*. The *self* parameter is required in the method definition and it must come before any other parameter. The reason it must be included in the definition is because when Python calls this method, to create an instance of *DigitalBook*, the method will automatically pass the self argument. Every method call associated with an instance automatically passes *self*, which is a reference to the instance itself, it provides the individual instances access to the attributes and methods in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an instance of *DigitalBook*, Python calls the *__init__()* method from the *DigitalBook* class. As we have added two other parameters after *self*, we will pass a book name and author name as arguments, *self* is passed automatically. Whenever we want to make an instance from the *DigitalBook* class, we need only provide values for the last two parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "At lines 6 and 7 we have defined two variables and prefixed them with *self*. A variable prefixed with *self* is available to every method in the class. We'll also be able to access these variables through any instance created from the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    self.name = name\n",
    "    \n",
    "takes the value associated with the parameter *name* and assigns it to the variable *name*, which is then attached to the instance being created. The thing happens with *self.author*. Variables that are accessible through instances like this are called *attributes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "At lines 9 and 14 we have two other methods defined, *open()* and *close()*. These methods don't need any additional information to run so we just define them to have one parameter, *self*. Any instances we created later will have access to these methods. This means that they will be able to open and close. At the moment *open()* and *close()* don't do too much, they simply print a message telling a user if the book is open of closed. But think about it in the context of real digital book on a tablet or mobile device. What we have just written would be used by someone to see the name of a book in their library and if they are reading it or not.\n",
